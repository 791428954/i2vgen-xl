# VGen


![figure1](source/VGen.jpg "figure1")

VGen is an open-source video synthesis codebase developed by the Tongyi Lab of Alibaba Group, featuring state-of-the-art video generative models. This repository includes implementations of the following methods:

- [I2VGen-xl: High-quality image-to-video synthesis via cascaded diffusion models](https://i2vgen-xl.github.io/)
- [VideoComposer: Compositional Video Synthesis with Motion Controllability](https://videocomposer.github.io/)
- [Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Decoupling for Text-to-Video Generation](https://higen-t2v.github.io/)
- [A Recipe for Scaling up Text-to-Video Generation with Text-free Videos]()
- [InstructVideo: Instructing Video Diffusion Models with Human Feedback]()
- [DreamVideo: Composing Your Dream Videos with Customized Subject and Motion](https://dreamvideo-t2v.github.io/)
- [VideoLCM: Video Latent Consistency Model]()
- [Modelscope text-to-video technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06571)


VGen can produce high-quality videos from the input text, images, desired motion, desired subjects, and even the feedback signals provided.  It also offers a variety of commonly used video generation tools such as visualization, sampling, training, inference, join training using images and videos, acceleration, and more.

## ðŸ”¥News!!!
- __[2023.12]__ We release the code and model of I2VGen-XL (Soon)
- __[2023.12]__ We write an [introduction docment](doc/introuctions.pdf) for VGen and compare I2VGen-XL with SVD.
- __[2023.11]__ We release a high-quality I2VGen-XL model, please refer to the [Webpage](https://i2vgen-xl.github.io)


## TODO
- [x] Release the technical papers and webpage of [I2VGen-XL](doc/i2vgen-xl.md)
- [ ] Release the code and pretrained models that can generate 1280x720 videos
- [ ] Release models optimized specifically for the human body and faces
- [ ] Updated version can fully maintain the ID and capture large and accurate motions simultaneously
- [ ] Release other methods and the corresponding models


## Installation:

Requirements:
- Python==3.8
- ffmpeg (for motion vector extraction)
